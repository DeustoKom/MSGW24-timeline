Steeped in military history, it offers tranquil walks and tarmac pathways leading to panoramic lookout points. The Sagrado Corazón statue, towering over its summit since 1950, symbolizes the city's spirit. At its peak, the Castillo de la Mota fortress stands as a testament to its defensive past, housing the Casa de la Historia de Urgull museum. Nearby, the English Cemetery holds legends of soldiers and tragic romances, adding layers to the mountain's lore.",,,,,,,,LightCyan

1920,,,,2024,,,,,Sagues,"The history of <a href=""https://www.gipuzkoasansebastian.eus/en/-/sagues"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Sagues</strong></a> traces back to the early 1920s when it emerged haphazardly around the Cemoriya slaughterhouse, catering to workers involved in <strong>Gros</strong> neighborhood's construction. The area's rapid growth led to inadequate housing, poor access, and social issues, drawing the attention of <strong>Francoist authorities</strong> who sought its demolition during the Civil War and subsequent dictatorship era.

Construction began in 1995, with the <strong>Chamber Hall</strong> hosting its first congress on June 3, 1999. The complex was officially inaugurated on August 23, 1999, featuring concerts by the <strong>Euskadi Symphony Orchestra</strong> and soprano <strong>Ainhoa Arteta</strong>, marking a new chapter in the city's cultural landscape.
