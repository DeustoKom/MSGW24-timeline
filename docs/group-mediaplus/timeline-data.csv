1916,,,,2024,,,,,Paseo Nuevo,"The Paseo Nuevo skirts Monte Urgull from the Harbour to the Calle Salamanca. Opened in 1916, the promenade has received several names over the years related to historic figures of the time, until in 1979 it was officially given the name by which it was popularly known, the Paseo Nuevo. Added to its views of the Bay of Biscay and the coast of Gipuzkoa, the Paseo is famous for the sight of its breaking waves, particularly in the area beside the Sociedad Fotográfica de Gipuzkoa, the entrance to the Plaza Zuloaga and the Calle San Juan.",https://www.sansebastianturismoa.eus/images/ssturismo/paseo_nuevo.jpg,"San Sebastián Turismo-Donostia Turismoa, S.A.",Paseo Nuevo from Above,,,,,SeaGreen

1922,,,,2024,,,,,Kursaal,"The Gran Kursaal building in San Sebastian, emblematic of the city's Belle Époque era, opened on July 29, 1922, but faced closure in 1924 due to a gambling ban. After serving as a provisional venue until 1972, plans emerged to replace it with an Auditorium and Congress Centre. Following a consultation in 1989, Rafael Moneo's design was chosen, emphasizing the site's geography and public space. Construction began in 1995, with the Chamber Hall hosting its first congress on June 3, 1999. The complex was officially inaugurated on August 23, 1999, featuring concerts by the Euskadi Symphony Orchestra and soprano Ainhoa Arteta, marking a new chapter in the city's cultural landscape.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfUIYcq7dX4&pp=ygUWa3Vyc2FhbCBzYW4gc2ViYXN0aWFuIA%3D%3D,Sistemas de Construccion,Construction and Planning for Kursaal,,,,,LightSteelBlue
