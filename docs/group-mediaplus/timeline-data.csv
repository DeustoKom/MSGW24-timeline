1200,,,,2024,,,,,Monte Urgull,"Monte Urgull, established as a fortified site in the 12th century, overlooks San Sebastián from one end of La Concha Bay. Steeped in military history, it offers tranquil walks and tarmac pathways leading to panoramic lookout points. The Sagrado Corazón statue, towering over its summit since 1950, symbolizes the city's spirit. At its peak, the Castillo de la Mota fortress stands as a testament to its defensive past, housing the Casa de la Historia de Urgull museum. Nearby, the English Cemetery holds legends of soldiers and tragic romances, adding layers to the mountain's lore.",,,,,,,,LightCyan
1813,,,,2024,,,,,Old Town ,"The Old Town of San Sebastián, established as the city's embryo and bordered by Mount Urgull, the River Urumea, and the Concha Bay, is a historical gem. It was once enclosed by city walls until their demolition in 1863. Ravaged during the War of Independence in 1813, it now thrives as the social heart of the city. The Plaza de la Constitución, once a bullring, now hosts vibrant local festivities. The Plaza de la Constitución (once a bullring), which is located inside the Old Town, now hosts vibrant local festivities. With its rich gastronomic scene, architectural gems like the San Vicente Church and Basilica of Santa María, and cultural attractions such as the San Telmo Museum, the Old Town beckons visitors to explore its history and charm.",,,,,,,,DarkRed

1920,,,,2024,,,,,Sagues,"Its history traces back to the early 1920(s) when it emerged haphazardly around the Cemoriya slaughterhouse, catering to workers involved in Gros neighborhood's construction. The area's rapid growth led to inadequate housing, poor access, and social issues, drawing the attention of Francoist authorities who sought its demolition during the Civil War and subsequent dictatorship era.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRE6v6W2wno&pp=ygUec2FndWVzIHNhbiBzZWJhc3RpYW4gc2thdGVwYXJr,PP San Sebastian,Views captured near Sagues,,,,,LightCyan
1922,,,,2024,,,,,Kursaal,"The Gran Kursaal building in San Sebastian, emblematic of the city's Belle Époque era, opened on July 29, 1922, but faced closure in 1924 due to a gambling ban. After serving as a provisional venue until 1972, plans emerged to replace it with an Auditorium and Congress Centre. Following a consultation in 1989, Rafael Moneo's design was chosen, emphasizing the site's geography and public space. Construction began in 1995, with the Chamber Hall hosting its first congress on June 3, 1999. The complex was officially inaugurated on August 23, 1999, featuring concerts by the Euskadi Symphony Orchestra and soprano Ainhoa Arteta, marking a new chapter in the city's cultural landscape.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfUIYcq7dX4&pp=ygUWa3Vyc2FhbCBzYW4gc2ViYXN0aWFuIA%3D%3D,Sistemas de Construccion,Construction and Planning for Kursaal,,,,,DarkRed
1926,,,,2024,,,,,Cristina Enea Park,"Cristina Enea Park, established in 1926 by Duke Fernando de Soraluce as a tribute to his wife, Cristina Brunetti, is a cherished green space in San Sebastián. It features diverse wildlife including birds, ducks, and peacocks, captivating fountains and lakes, and amenities like play areas and picnic spots. The park's centerpiece, the Duke of Mandas Palace, now serves as an environmental interpretation center offering exhibitions and activities related to nature.
